Introduction to Programming Final Project:

Magnet Clue Description: In this game a murder has happened at Magnet and it is up to the player to solve the case! Magnet Clue is a game where the computer randomly (out of six choices each) picks a room, a weapon, and a murderer, and it is the job of the player to guess it. After each guess, the player is given a hint as to which room, weapon, or suspect it is. They can also see the choices they have picked incorrectly to help narrow down their search. If they guess the room, weapon, and suspect correctly within three tries, the game is over. If not, the murderer will find and confront them and they will fight until one of them wins.
